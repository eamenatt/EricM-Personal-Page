                My name is Eric Menatti and I'm an aspiring sofware developer. I completed my undergraduate's degree
                in Management Information Systems from Clemson University in 2013 and have been a Software sales
                professional for the past 7 years. I've gained experience working with customers across the Federal
                Government and the Events
                Industry.
                <br><br>
                I was born in France and lived between the US and Belgium until 2001. I currently live in Arlington, VA
                with my girlfriend, Elaine. Some of my main hobbies are hiking local trails, tinkering
                with my PC, and gaming with friends. I am completing a 6 month Full Stack Development
                course through George Washington University and am expecting to Graduate in January 2021. In the
                meantime, I will be pursuing technical certifications in addition to my studies with the possibility
                of working part time.
                <br><br>
                I'm looking forward to finding a full time posistion doing what I love in an industry that I'm
                passionate about.

            <p>
                My name is Eric Menatti and I'm an aspiring sofware developer. I completed my undergraduates degree
                in Management Information Systems from Clemson University in 2013 and have been a Software sales
                professional for the past 7 years, working with customers in the Federal Government, and the Events
                Industry. I was born in France and lived between the US and Belgium until 2001. I currently live in
                Arlington, VA with my girlfriend, Elaine. Some of my main hobbies are hiking local trails, tinkering
                with my PC, and gaming with friends. I am currently completing a 6 month Full Stack Development
                course through George Washington University and am expecting to Graduate in January 2021. In the
                meantime I will be pursuing technical certifications in addition to my studies with the possibility
                of working part time.
